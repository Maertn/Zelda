I'll keep the devlog.txt open as a devlog / notepad.

# Setting up GitHub
The first thing that I'll try to do is push this README onto github and switch to a branch. 
After the first part of the tutorial is done I'll merge to main.
One problem that might emerge is excluding the virtual environment from the commit. I'll be experimenting with .gitignore.
I think I've already set up configuration for connecting with GitHub from VSCode, so I'll be good to go.

I realised that README.txt is printed in GitHub, so I've switched to another file for keeping track.
I made an .gitignore and tested it with success. I'll create a venv and add it to ignored files. 

I wanted to make a last change by installing pygame and updating requirements.txt. 
I couldn't push with Git, and realised that I'd already switched branches.
To my amazement, with requirements.txt open, I can see the content change when I switch branches through console.
I'll set upstream for my new branch 1.level, named after the folder in the original project (https://github.com/clear-code-projects/Zelda)
