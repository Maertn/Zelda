This is a code along with a tutorial provided on YouTube by Clear Code. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw)
The result should be a game programmed in Python using the pygame module, inspired by Zelda.
As part of the learning experience I'm using GitHub.
I'll keep the README.txt open as a devlog / notepad.

# Setting up GitHub
The first thing that I'll try to do is push this README onto github and switch to a branch. 
After the first part of the tutorial is done I'll merge to main.
One problem that might emerge is excluding the virtual environment from the commit. I'll be experimenting with .gitignore.
I think I've already set up configuration for connecting with GitHub from VSCode, so I'll be good to go.
